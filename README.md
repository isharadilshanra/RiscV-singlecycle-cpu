# RiscV-singlecycle-cpu
a 32-bit non-pipelined RISC-V processor using an FPGA  platform. used Quartus for simulation and design. develop a fully operational RISC-V processor that handle  instruction types such as R, I, S, and SB.  Also included the integration of custom  instructions, MEMCOPY and MUL, designed to augment the processor's functionality
